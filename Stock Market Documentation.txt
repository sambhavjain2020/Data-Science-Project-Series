Stock Market Prediction Project Documentation


Introduction -
The goal of this project is to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques and gain insights from the provided stock market dataset. The dataset contains various features related to stock prices, technical indicators, and other relevant information.


Approach - 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Data Loading and Overview:
Loaded the dataset using Pandas.
Printed the first few rows to understand the structure of the data.

2. Summary Statistics:
Computed descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features to gain an initial understanding of the dataset.

3. Visualization:
Plotted key statistics and trends in stock prices over time using Seaborn.
Utilized line plots to visualize the closing prices and detect potential patterns or trends.


Feature Engineering - 
1. Date Conversion:
Converted the 'Date' column to a datetime format for time-based analysis.
Extracted additional date-related features (year, month, day) for improved model performance.


Predictive Modeling - 
1. Linear Regression Model:
Implemented a Linear Regression model to predict stock prices.
Selected relevant features, including date-related and historical stock price information.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
Trained the model using the training set and evaluated its performance using the root mean squared error (RMSE).

2. Random Forest Regression Model:
Implemented a Random Forest Regression model to capture non-linear relationships.
Used the same features as in the Linear Regression model.
Trained the model and evaluated its performance using RMSE.


Insights - 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
1. Trends in Stock Prices:
Identified general trends and patterns in stock prices over time.
Explored potential seasonality and cyclic behavior.

2. Feature Importance:
Investigated the importance of various features in predicting stock prices.
Considered factors such as volume, technical indicators, and historical prices.


Predictive Modeling:
1. Model Performance:
Compared the performance of the Linear Regression and Random Forest Regression models.
Analyzed RMSE to understand the accuracy of the models in predicting stock prices.

2. Feature Contribution:
Examined the contribution of individual features in predicting stock prices.
Provided insights into which features are more influential in the predictive models.


Conclusion - 
This project aimed to explore, analyze, and predict stock prices based on historical data. The chosen models and insights gained from the EDA provide a foundation for further refinement and optimization. The documentation outlines the step-by-step approach, methodologies, and key findings throughout the project.
